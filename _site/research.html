<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>To support elementary school teachers in teaching by encouraging active learning while maintaining the interest of pupils, this study focuses on supporting teaching, learning, and monitoring the progress of students through a Teacher–Robot collaboration lesson application using not only laptops and tablets, but also robots and sensors. Since developing a lesson application is time consuming for teachers, we have developed an integrated intelligent application development platform named PRactical INTElligent aPplicationS (PRINTEPS) to aid Teacher–Robot collaboration. However, several functions and interfaces for education are missing. Therefore, in this study, we extend several functions for education to PRINTEPS. In addition, since it is necessary in learning and monitoring the progress of students to present learning content suitable to each pupil’s level of understanding, we also have provided support through the use of a tablet quiz system based on ontologies and rule bases. In the case study, we developed a Teacher–Robot collaboration lesson application and conducted lessons for sixth-grade pupils at an elementary school. From the case study, we have confirmed the effectiveness of our platform and the application.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-1">Abstract</h2>
<p>Although AI and service robot applications have become very popular in many domains recently, many of them are specific applications and it is still difficult to develop integrated intelligent applications such as a robot teahouse and teaching assistant robots. To develop such integrated intelligent applications, we need integrated intelligent application platforms that have AI integration and agile process facilities. From the above background, we are currently developing PRactical INTElligent aPplicationS (PRINTEPS), which is a platform for developing integrated intelligent applications by combining only five types of modules, namely knowledge-based reasoning, spoken dialogue, image sensing, motion management, and machine learning. This paper proposes a workflow editor in PRINETPS based on a service-oriented architecture and a Robot Operating System that enables real-time parallel processing for multiple robots and sensors by integrating the five types of modules. The editor also supports not only developers but also domain experts in updating workflows frequently. This paper also proposes a novel method to integrate signals acquired through image sensing with knowledge (ontologies and business rules) using C-SPARQL and Semantic Web Rule Language. To evaluate PRINTEPS, we developed a robot teahouse application including customer reception and guidance to table services using a humanoid robot with PRINTEPS. Through this case study, we demonstrated that the behaviors of the robot can be modified by changing the workflow, the ontology, and the rules.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-2">Abstract</h2>
<p>Recently, smart glasses have been applied in field work, with which a worker goes well during work by contacting a support operator from a remote location. The worker, however, cannot go well if the support operator is not there. To solve the issues, the paper discusses how a work system should be developed by integrating smart glasses with a question-answering module. We design the work knowledge acquired from skilled people and manuals as a work flow, rule base, goal tree, domain ontologies and RDF data. Workers follow work process by referring to the work flow, referring to multimedia, and receiving answers from the question-answering module incorporated with a knowledge base for questions that are raised during the work. The authors conducted a demonstration experiment and found that workers could perform the work more autonomously by importing the system.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-4">Abstract</h2>
<p>Recently, the use of service robots has increased considerably and their social contribution is expected. It is desirable that a robot, as a provider of operational information, can answer questions in both the open domain and intended operations, to respond to questions in a manner that satisfies users. This paper proposes a question answering system that can respond to questions in both intended operations and open domain by linking an ontology, which is semi-automatically built from Wikipedia (Wikipedia-based ontology), with a domain ontology.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-5">Abstract</h2>
<p>This study aims at developing a web service with Japanese Linked Data and evaluating the service. Recently, Japanese government has set open data as a new strategy in information technology field and focuses on ‘Linked Open Data (LOD)’ as a means to publish. However, the number of dataset as Japanese Linked Data is small, and the effect by introducing Japanese Linked Data has not been shown yet. Therefore, we created Japanese Linked Data focused on geographical or positional data, and implemented a mobility service to reduce user’s cognitive load. Moreover, we conducted verification experiment for using the service and compared with conventional services. As a result, the possibilities of Linked Data to respond to various queries easily and to apply for information services by crossing some domains were explored.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-6">Abstract</h2>
<p>Traffic behaviour surveys by hand require both a lot of money and human resources. Recently, traffic behaviour surveys using information technology have been carried out. In this study, we propose a method to extract staying points from GPS-based positional data, to identify the types of staying facilities by using Google Places API, a facility ontology, the regularity which is analysed from trip chains about traffic behaviour and to determine the behaviour objectives based on the rules between the behaviour objectives and the types of staying facilities. This method could identify 67.9% behaviour objectives in the evaluation using GPS location data from the traffic behaviour survey in Nagasaki.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-7">Abstract</h2>
<p>As Linked Data consumption has not yet been discussed from the points of information services, we discuss here how to build web applications with function extendibility and service maintainability, integrating Linked Data and rule bases. The function extendibility has been done with less cost just by linking original Linked Data and other Linked Data. The service maintainability has been done just by exchanging initial rules for given task with other rules for another task. Using the framework, we have implemented web application for diet therapy and then discussed how well the diet therapy service goes well with the questionnaire survey of a diabetic.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-8">Abstract</h2>
<p>In this research, we propose a method and a tool to detect the difference between as-is models and reference models. The tool supports factory management to recognize pros and cons of the as-is model, and to understand current conditions. We use the supply-chain operations reference-model (SCOR model) as a specific reference model that covers supply chain management. There are three main problems to be solved in order to achieve our goal. The first problem is to make as-is model and reference-model described by a machine-readable format. The second problem is to adjust the abstraction level of the as-is model and the reference model. The third problem is to extract the difference automatically by comparing the as-is model and the reference model. In this paper, we propose a support tool for the production management process modeling based on SCOR ontology in order to solve the first and second problems. SCOR ontology means the building blocks of the SCOR model (concepts and relationships between the concepts related to production management) described by a machine-readable format. In order to verify the effectiveness of our proposed tool, we used it to make production management processes in a manufacturing company. We confirmed that our tool could appropriately make the as-is model. In addition, we could adjust the abstraction level between the as-is model and the reference model automatically by using a machine-readable SCOR ontology and the model.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-9">Abstract</h2>
<p>Here is discussed how to build up Japanese vocabulary for Japanese Linked Open Data. The vocabulary is constructed by mapping properties of the Japanese Wikipedia Ontology to the Linked Open Vocabularies. The Japanese Wikipedia Ontology is a large scale ontology learned from the Japanese Wikipedia. It includes many properties and property relations (property domains and property ranges). The Linked Open Vocabularies is a large cloud for vocabularies of Linked Open Data. We construct a Japanese vocabulary semi-automatically by mapping properties to vocabularies. Experimental case studies show us that we can use the built Japanese vocabulary as a general vocabulary for building Japanese Linked Open Data.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-10">Abstract</h2>
<p>Previously, we constructed the Japanese Wikipedia Ontology (JWO) via a semi-automatic process using the Japanese Wikipedia, but it had problems due to a lack of upper classes and appropriate definitions of properties. Thus, the aim of the current study was to complement the upper classes in JWO by refining and integrating JWO and Japanese WordNet (JWN) to build a class hierarchy with defined properties based on the considerations of property inheritance. To achieve this, we developed tools that help users to refine the class-instance relationships, to identify the JWO classes that need to be aligned with JWN synsets, and to align the JWO classes with the JWN synsets via user interaction. We also integrated JWO and JWN using a domain ontology development environment, DODDLE-OWL. We also propose a method for building a class hierarchy with defined properties by elevating the common properties defined in sibling classes to higher classes in JWO.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-11">Abstract</h2>
<p>This paper reports on the results of a pioneering experiment to formulate a body of knowledge (BOK) of a new academic field, such as social informatics, as a collective intelligence using WikiBOK - a BOK formulation-aid system. Our approach was based on a reverse engineering analysis of an institution’s curriculum, such that a set of BOK element candidates were extracted and used to formulate a BOK of the target field collectively using WikiBOK. The method was applied to create a BOK of the School of Social Informatics at Aoyama Gakuin University, revealing that it consisted of eleven distinct areas (or disciplinary subfields). The reverse engineering approach showed that the traditional approach of obtaining a BOK through clustering a set of course works was unsuccessful. Alternativly, it is expected that through the adoption of our approach, anyone will be able to construct a BOK of a particular discipline of interest.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-12">Abstract</h2>
<p>WioNA (Wikipedia Ontology NAo) is proposed to build much better HRI by integrating four elements: Japanese speech interface, semantic interpretation, Japanese Wikipedia Ontology and Robot Action Ontology. WioNA is implemented on a humanoid robot “Nao”. In WioNA, we developed two ontologies: Japanese Wikipedia Ontology and Robot Action Ontology. Japanese Wikipedia Ontology has a large size of concept hierarchy and instance network with many properties from Japanese Wikipedia (semi) automatically. By giving Japanese Wikipedia Ontology to Nao as wisdom, Nao can dialogue with users on many topics of various fields. Robot Action Ontology, in contrast, is built by organizing various performable actions of Nao to control and generate robot actions. Aligning Robot Action Ontology with Japanese Wikipedia Ontology enables Nao to perform related actions to dialogue topics. To show the validities of WioNA, we describe human-robot conversation logs of two case studies whose dialogue topics are sport and rock singer. These case studies show us how HRI goes well in WioNA with these topics.</p>

<p>Here is discussed how to build up ontologies with many properties from Japanese Wikipedia. The ontologies include is-a relationship (rdfs:subClassOf), class-instance relationship (rdf:type) and synonym relation (skos:altLabel) moreover it includes property relations and types. Property relations are triples, property domain (rdfs:domain) and property range (rdfs:range). Property types are object (owl:ObjectProperty), data (owl:DatatypeProperty), symmetric (owl:SymmetricProperty), transitive (owl:TransitiveProperty), functional (owl:FunctionalProperty) and inverse functional (owl:InverseFunctionalProperty). Experimental case studies show us that the built Japanese Wikipedia Ontology goes better than DBpedia from utility when we use, such as Hub of Linked Data, especially in Japan.</p>

Experimental case studies show us that the learned Japanese Wikipedia Ontology goes better than already existing general linguistic ontologies, such as EDR and Japanese WordNet, from the points of building costs and structure information richness.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-15">Abstract</h2>
<p>In this paper, we propose a supporting method for developments of Web applications in order to support communication between users and developers. Our method combines three-layer architecture modeling of Web application and knowledge sharing technologies based on ontologies. The ontologies, which are used in the method and called enterprise application ontology (EAO), enable users and developers to form common understanding about system specification. EAO covers three aspects (legal aspect, business process, and software design) of business which is a candidate of development of a Web application. EAO includes three ontologies constructed from each of the three aspects. Concepts and structure of EAO are applied on page transition models, which are called Web Process Architecture, of a Web application. As a case study, we applied our method for a development of a ledger accounting system in a local government. And we confirmed that our method could support the development on the business analysis phase.</p>

<h2 id="abstract-16">Abstract</h2>
<p>In this paper, we propose an interactive domain ontology development environment called DODDLE-OWL. DODDLE-OWL refers to existing ontologies and supports the semi-automatic construction of taxonomic and other relationships in domain ontologies from documents. Integrating several modules, DODDLE-OWL is a practical and interactive domain ontology development environment. In order to evaluate the efficiency of DODDLE-OWL, we compared DODDLE-OWL with popular manual-building method. In order to evaluate the scalability of DODDLE-OWL, we constructed a large sized ontology over 34,000 concepts in the field of rocket operation using DODDLE-OWL. Through the above evaluation, we confirmed the efficiency and the scalability of DODDLE-OWL. Currently, DODDLE-OWL is open source software in Java and has 100 and more users from 20 and more countries.</p>

<h1 id="a-graphical-rdf-based-meta-model-management-tool"><a id="section-1">A Graphical RDF-based Meta-Model Management Tool</a></h1>

<h2 id="abstract-17">Abstract</h2>
<p>We propose a tool to manage several sorts of relationships among RDF (Resource Description Framework) and RDFS (RDF Schema). Our tool consists of three main functions: graphical editing of RDF descriptions, graphical editing of RDFS descriptions, and meta-model management facilities. In this paper, we focus on the meta-model management, a key concept which is defined as the appropriate management of the correspondence between a model and its meta-model: especially, the class and property in the meta-model, and the type of RDF resource and property in the model. The above facilities are implemented based on the plug-in system. We provide basic plug-in modules for checking the consistency of RDFS classes and properties. The prototyping tool, called MR<sup>3</sup> (Meta-Model Management based on RDFs Revision Reflection), is implemented by Java language. Through an experiment using MR<sup>3</sup>, we show how MR<sup>3</sup> contributes to the Semantic Web paradigm from the standpoint of RDFs description management.</p>
